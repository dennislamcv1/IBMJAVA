# Section 1: Architecture summary

As a Java developer working on the Smart Clinic application, I’d describe its architecture as a clean, layered Spring Boot system that follows the principles of separation of concerns and scalability. The application is designed to serve both web users (through server-rendered views) and mobile or frontend clients (via REST APIs), which makes it adaptable for multiple user experiences.

The request lifecycle begins at the User Interface Layer, where end users interact either through Thymeleaf-powered web dashboards or external REST clients. These interactions are directed to specific Controller Layer endpoints—Thymeleaf controllers for rendering HTML and REST controllers for serving JSON responses. The controllers act as gatekeepers: they handle input validation and delegate processing to the Service Layer, which is the core of our business logic. This service tier handles tasks like validating appointment rules or coordinating between different entities such as doctors and patients.

Behind the scenes, services rely on the Repository Layer to manage data access. We’ve employed a hybrid database strategy: MySQL via Spring Data JPA for relational data and MongoDB via Spring Data MongoDB for document-oriented data like prescriptions. This dual-database approach allows us to balance structured and flexible storage based on the nature of the data.

Data flows seamlessly through the application using strongly typed Java model classes—JPA @Entity objects for relational data and Mongo @Document objects for documents. These models are used either to render dynamic HTML through Thymeleaf in the MVC flow or to produce clean JSON outputs in the REST flow. Altogether, this architecture allows Smart Clinic to be robust, maintainable, and future-proof across a variety of clients and use cases.

# Section 2: Numbered flow of data and control

1. User Interaction (UI Layer)
The flow begins when a user—such as an admin, doctor, or patient—interacts with the system through either a Thymeleaf-based web dashboard or a REST API client (e.g., mobile app). This could be anything from submitting a form to requesting data via an API call.

2. Controller Entry Point (Controller Layer)
The incoming HTTP request is routed to a specific controller based on the URL and HTTP method.
•	If it’s a web request, it’s handled by a Thymeleaf Controller, which prepares an HTML view.
•	If it’s an API request, it’s handled by a REST Controller, which prepares a JSON response.

3. Business Logic Invocation (Service Layer)
Controllers delegate processing to Service Layer classes. These services encapsulate business logic, validations, and workflows—such as verifying appointment availability or managing patient data consistency.

4. Data Access Request (Repository Layer)
If the business logic requires accessing or modifying data, the service layer calls the Repository Layer.
- JPA Repositories interact with MySQL for structured data (e.g., users, appointments).
- Mongo Repositories interact with MongoDB for document data (e.g., prescriptions).

5. Database Operations (Data Layer)
The repositories translate the data access commands into SQL queries (for MySQL) or document operations (for MongoDB). The underlying database engines perform the requested operations and return the results.

6. Model Binding (Entity/Document Mapping)
Returned data is bound to Java model classes:
- MySQL results are mapped to JPA @Entity classes.
- MongoDB results are mapped to @Document classes.
These model objects represent real-world domain entities in an object-oriented format.

7. Response Generation (UI/JSON Output)
Finally, the model data is used to generate a response:
- In the web flow, the data is passed into Thymeleaf templates and rendered as HTML.
- In the API flow, the model (or DTO) is serialized into JSON and sent back in the HTTP response.
